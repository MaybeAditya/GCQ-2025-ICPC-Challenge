ime Limit: 8.0 secondsMemory Limit: 1024 MBProblem StatementYou are the Chief Architect of the "Ouroboros" distributed supercomputer, which consists of $N$ quantum nodes connected in a tree structure. The network is subject to relativistic time dilation.Each node $u$ has a "temporal weight" $W_u$ and a "stability frequency" $F_u$.The network is highly unstable. You must process $Q$ queries of two types:Temporal Shift (Update): The connection between node $u$ and node $v$ is severed, and a new connection is formed between node $x$ and node $y$. The graph is guaranteed to remain a forest (a collection of trees).Synchronization Check (Query): For a given path between node $u$ and node $v$, calculate the "Resonance Sum".The Resonance Sum $R(u, v)$ is defined as:$$R(u, v) = \sum_{k \in \text{path}(u, v)} \left( \phi(W_k) \times \mu(F_k) \right) \mod (10^9 + 7)$$Where:$\phi(x)$ is the Euler's Totient Function.$\mu(x)$ is the Möbius Function.However, the transmission is subject to noise. The actual value contributed by a node is the convolution of its neighbors' weights. Specifically, for every node on the path, you must effectively compute a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the weights of its subtree in the auxiliary "virtual" tree structure to determine the final coefficient.Input FormatThe first line contains two integers $N$ and $Q$ ($1 \le N, Q \le 2 \cdot 10^5$).The second line contains $N$ integers representing the initial weights $W_u$.The next $N-1$ lines define the initial tree edges.The next $Q$ lines describe the operations (Cut/Link or Query).Output FormatFor each Type 2 query, output the Resonance Sum modulo $10^9 + 7$.Constraints$1 \le N, Q \le 200,000$$1 \le W_u, F_u \le 10^6$Critical Constraint: The topology changes dynamically (edges are cut and added).
